# Virtual-Health-Assistant
Virtual Health Assistant is an AI-powered web application designed to assist clinical doctors in disease prediction and Pakistani medicine recommendation. This platform leverages machine learning classifiers (Random Forest and Naive Bayes) to enhance the decision-making process for healthcare professionals, providing quicker, more accurate consultations. The project is developed with a focus on a user-friendly interface, robust database management, and secure user authentication.

# Technologies Used:
1) Firebase: User Authentication
2) PostgreSQL: Patient Record Management
3) ReactJS: Single Page Application (SPA)
4) Bootstrap 5: Responsive UI Design
5) Figma: UI/UX Design and Prototyping
6) Flask: Backend for Model Deployment and Database CRUD Operations
7) Naive Bayes: Disease Prediction Model
8) Random Forest: Disease Prediction and Medication Recommendation Model
9) Jupyter Notebooks: For model development and experimentation.
10) Scikit-Learn: Python library for implementing machine learning algorithms Naive Bayes and Random Forest.
11) TensorFlow: Used for additional model training to improve accuracy.

# Project Overview:
+ **Developed Machine Learning models** with 85% accuracy for disease prediction and medication recommendations, effectively reducing consultation times for doctors by approximately 15%.
